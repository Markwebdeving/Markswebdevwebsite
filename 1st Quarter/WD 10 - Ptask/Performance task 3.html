<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px";>In the realm of the web, let's tread with care,<br>
A world of knowledge, vast and rare.<br>
With every click and every share,<br>
Responsibility we must bear.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px";>To connect and learn, we all aspire,<br>
But let's ensure our hearts don't tire.<br>
For kindness, respect, and truth's the fire,<br>
That fuels the internet's great empire.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px";>In this digital age, where voices unite,<br>
Let's use our screens to spread the light.<br>
With empathy as our guiding site,<br>
We'll make the online world pure and bright.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px";>So surg with purpose, and always be wise,<br>
Guard against the web's deceitful guise.<br>
With proper use, our spirits will rise,<br>
A harmonious internet, our ultimate prize.</p>
